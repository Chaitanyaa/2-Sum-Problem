# 2-SUM PROBLEM
•	2-Sum problem is a java based graphic user interface application<br/>
•	It is an animated depiction of various solutions for a mathematical statement: Given an unsorted array ‘A’ of integers and a target sum ‘T’, we need to determine whether or not there are two numbers ‘X’ and ’Y’ in A such that X+Y=T.<br/>
•	Soln1: To compare the sum of every possible pair in the given array with the target sum.Time complexity: O(n2).<br/>
•	Soln2: For each x in the given array find t-x in the array via binary search.Time complexity :O(nlogn).<br/>
•	Soln3: For each x in the given array lookup t-x in the array via HashTable.Time complexity :O(n).<br/>	
Aim: To get familiar with JAVA programming for building desktop applications using Netbeans<br/>
